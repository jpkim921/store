# Trooff

Trooff is an e-commerce store project I took on in an attempt to learn Python and the Django framework. I wanted to focus on learning the language and framework and not worry about the design so much so I utilized the free [MBD e-commerce](https://mdbootstrap.com/freebies/jquery/e-commerce/) template and adapted it to my project.

#### Current functions:
- Catalog of products
- Filter products (by name and/or category)
- Add to cart/Remove from cart
- Order Summary (Cart)
 
#### Next steps:
- Add user authentication

- Pagination
  
  


#### See the [demo](https://youtu.be/c6oNQahs1_s) of the project so far.
